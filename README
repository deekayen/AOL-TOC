This is a script to logon to AOL IM using the TOC protocol.
There is only one official publication for TOC and a few
Perl based TOC scripts. AFAIK, this is the most complete
AOL IM implementation in PHP to date. The most of the protocol
is supported except chat. The remainder of the work are more
minor things like managing a buddy list - who's online, what
their warning level is, and if they're away or not. Error
handling is quite crappy, too.
